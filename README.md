# HnLive

A basic [Hacker News][0] live updating client using Phoenix LiveView. Just an experiment/playground for now.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000/hn) from your browser.
